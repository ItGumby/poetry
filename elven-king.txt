Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
Of him the harpers sadly sing:
The last whose realm was fair and free,
Between the Mountains and the Sea.

His sword was long, his lance was keen,
His shining helm afar was seen,
The countless stars of heaven’s field,
Were mirrored in his silver shield.

But long ago he rode away,
And where he dwelth none can say,
For into darkness fell his star,
In Mordor where the shadows are.
